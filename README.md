"actual wild dog simulator" is a project that I made during my year at queens, when the only coding course I was taking was teaching us how to use processsing.py for some reason. I was using it to make games and was also watching lots of youtube videos about neural networks at the time, so I decided to combine the two. The result is a neural network that doesn't ever seem to improve at the game for some reason, and I'm not sure if this is because the game is designed in a way that no player *can* improve (as in there is a point where there are no options the player can take to avoid losing), or I made a mistake coding the neural network. Anyways it was fun to make and it's fun to watch the dogs move around and choose their targets. This project was finished around November of 2019 if I remember correctly.
